# Swarm

Create swarms of monsters and critters that move as one. Rats, bats, ravens, bugs, pretty butterflies or even trolls (who wouldn't want to fight a swarm of trolls?) every token can be made into a swarm.

## Installation

Install by searching for _swarm_ in the module browsing tool or manually using this url: https://github.com/strongpauly/swarm/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Useage

Right click any token (or an actors prototype token) and bring up the token config.

-   Enable your swarm by checking the box **Swarm**
-   Check the **over** box to have your swarm fly over other tokens/players or leave it unchecked for under. Bats and crows fly over, whereas spiders under.
-   **Count** is the number of critters in your swarm
-   **Speed** lets you configure the critters individual speeds. Are they moving too fast, reduce this number.
-   At last you have a drop-down box where you can choose the swarm animation, see below.

On the next tab: _Appearance_

-   If you are modifying a prototype token, you can enter a wildcard pattern as your image. If enabled as well, your swarm will draw randomly from the wildcard token images.
-   Modify the **Scale** to reduce or increase the size of the individual critters.
-   Change the dimensions to create a larger area where the bugs crawl.
-   Mirror image if your critters e.g., move backward.
-   Reduce the opacity to remove the "large" token

And you should have your swarm ready for action.

## Localization

Current support for:

-   English -- https://github.com/oOve
-   Your language ?

If you want to translate this module, download [this file](lang/en.json) and translate it. After that open an issue sharing your translation. Also share the default name convention for your language. You can find that by either, finding a system or module that is already translated to your language and open its module.json. It should look something like this: `"languages": [ { "lang": "en", "name": "English", "path": "lang/en.json" }`

## Compatibility

Tested on [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/ "Foundry VTT") version 12.
