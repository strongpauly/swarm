# Swarm

Create swarms of monsters and critters that move as one. Rats, bats, ravens, bugs, pretty butterflies or even trolls (who wouldn't want to fight a swarm of trolls?) every token can be made into a swarm.

-   Enable your swarm by checking the box **Swarm Enabled**
-   **Count** is the number of critters in your swarm
-   **Speed** lets you configure the critters individual speeds. Are they moving too fast, reduce this number.
-   At last you have a drop-down box where you can choose the swarm animation, see below.

On the _Appearance_ tab additional options will affect the swarm:
-   If you are modifying a prototype token, you can enter a wildcard pattern in your **Image Path**. If enabled as well, your swarm will draw randomly from the wildcard token images.
-   Modify the **Scale** to reduce or increase the size of the individual critters.
-   Change the **Dimensions** to create a larger area where the bugs crawl.
-   **Mirror Image** if your critters e.g., move backward.
-   Reduce the **Opacity** of the Swarm
-   Modify the **Tint** of the Swarm

And you should have your swarm ready for action.

## Localization

Current support for:

-   English -- https://github.com/oOve
-   Your language ?

If you want to translate this module, download [this file](lang/en.json) and translate it. After that open an issue sharing your translation. Also share the default name convention for your language. You can find that by either, finding a system or module that is already translated to your language and open its module.json. It should look something like this: `"languages": [ { "lang": "en", "name": "English", "path": "lang/en.json" }`

## Compatibility

Tested on [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/ "Foundry VTT") version 12.
